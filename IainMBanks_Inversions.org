Inversions is the sixth book in the Culture series but is only weakly connected with the other books.
It is rather a more-or-less classical fantasy novel.

It is set in a medieval-like world and has two story lines.
The first describes the life of the king's physician written from the perspective of her assistant.
The second one explores the actions of the bodyguard of the ruler of another kingdom.
Even though a war is raging in the world, the novel is fixated mostly on both protagonists and their environment.

The connections with the rest of the Culture series is clear only if the reader is familiar with the rest of the universe.
But even without this knowledge, it contains two entertaining stories.
With this knowledge, this book fits neatly into the rest of the universe.
It is a well written book but a poor introduction to the series.
