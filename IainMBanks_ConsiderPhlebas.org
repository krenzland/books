Consider Phlebas is a solid space opera.

Its main strength is the morally ambigous characters - it is hard to say which characters belong to the 'good' and which to the 'evil' side. 

Its main weakness is the plot. Whilst the main idea - a spaceship mind fleeing - is good, the execution is not ideal. The first three quarters of the book are spent mostly with irrelevant tangents in which the protagonists bum around the galaxy, doing everything but evolving the plot.
The last quarter is focussed only on the main goal but is slightly repetitive.

Everything else is solid, or better. Banks managed to build a believable world which is inhabited by (mostly) fascinating characters. The writing is above average.

All in all it is a wortwhile read with many intense and suspensful moments.
