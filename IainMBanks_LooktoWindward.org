The seventh book of the Culture series, Look to Windward is a stand-alone novel, but is loosely coupled with the ending of Consider Phlebeas.

Whilst the previous books considered the action mostly from the perspective of the Culture, this book is mainly told from the viewpoint of other, equally developed species.
This means that we are able to see how the culture is viewed by other civilisations.

The plot moves painfully slow at times but this only gives Banks more time to describe the characters and the worlds they live in with more detail.

Overall I can recommend this book. The new perspectives paint a completely new picture of the setting. This leads, also thanks to Banks' strong writing, to a very enjoyable read.
