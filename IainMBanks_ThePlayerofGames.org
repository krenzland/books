The Player of Games is a great science fiction novel. 

Even though it is driven by a strong plot, the main attraction is the interaction between the protagonist and the inhabitants of the empire Azad.
Whilst the Culture is an anarchist society that values personal rights, Azad is a rather totalitarian state.

This state is governed by an elite that consists of people which exceed at the game Azad.
Because Azad is strongly entwined with the empire of the same name,
the actual gameplay is a proxy for the empire's politics.
It represents the political believes of the player itself.
Using this duality, Banks explores this cultural conflict from different perspectives, whilst maintaining a sufficiently fast paced plot.

Overall the book is a very interesting read, especially because the plot is a stark contrast to most other sci-fi novels which favour a militaristic perspective.
