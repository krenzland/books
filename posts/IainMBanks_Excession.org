Excession is the fifth novel of the Culture series.
This book deals with the Culture's reaction to an "outside context problem", a term invented by Iain Banks.
It is a problem that is unexpected for the current state of a societal and is thus outside their current context.

But this story isn't really about that.
It rather explores the communication of different hyper-intelligent ships which mostly act for their own benefit or amusement.
The biological characters in this book try to deal with their life in a world, where there's no strong need for human involvement anymore.
Of course, the seemly irrelevant subplots are all connected in one way or the other, which is, like in most Culture novels, not at all obvious for the first 90% of the story.

It is one of the stronger books in the Culture universe and is a necessary read.
