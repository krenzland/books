Despite the title promising an overly militaristic novel, war is mostly used to demonstrate the dramatic life of the protagonist Zakalwe.
This, of course, does not mean that the reader should not expect the usual amount of violence used by Banks.

Zakalwe is a mercenary who works for the Culture, Banks' post-scarcity utopia.
The nature of Zakalwe's work often leads to conflict with the core values of the Culture, which not only is an interesting aspect of the story but also shows the careful worldbuilding employed by Banks.

Use of Weapons uses alternating, interwoven chapters, the first group follows time linearly and the other chapters go back in time, sometimes with drastic jumps.
This approach might be confusing at first, but it also allows Banks to create a believable character.
The forward-moving chapters tell a - at first glance relatively standard sci-fi plot - whilst Zakalwe's past is explored in the backward moving chapters.
Even though the past of the protagonist is known to some extent, Banks succeeds with various surprising plot-twists.

Use of Weapons is a great work of fiction which is, even despite the complicated structure, very readable.
