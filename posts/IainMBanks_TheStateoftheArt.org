The State of the Art is the only short story collection in the Culture universe.
Banks usually excels in long-winded, complicated plots.
This resulted in a book that is a bit weaker than the longer ones.
Two of the included stories are very much worth reading though.

The first one "Descendant" describes a lone man lost on a planet with his space suit as his only companion.
The second one, "The State of the Art" is a roughly 100 pages long novella in which the planet Earth is first contacted by the Culture.
It contains the classical culture conflict of involvement vs. non-involvement and is surprisingly funny at times.
