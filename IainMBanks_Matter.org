The eight book of the Culture series is the most complicated one.

It's set mostly in the sphere-world Sursamen, a world that consists of many slices, all of them inhabited by a different species/society.
Even though it could be argued that Sursamen is the real protagonist, there are of course humanoid actors.
Some of them come from this world, others are culture agents.

The novel then explores a medieval-like civil war, the connection to the other species, the role of the culture and, of course, an evil plot threatening to destroy the entire world.
The involvement of the culture results in a multi-planetary narrative.
All story lines are, as usual, somehow entangled, but this only becomes clear in the last few chapters.
Because the story is told from so many radically different perspectives the novel is very rich in variety.
In fact, Banks manages to pack more diverse content in this single book than other authors in complete series!

This all leads to a very complicated story which, sometimes, makes the novel hard to follow.
Overall it is a very enjoyable long read but probably the worst book to start the series with.
